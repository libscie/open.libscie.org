We provide ResearchEquals to research conducting organizations.

## ...is an integrated, public, digital research environment

Here researchers search, gather, document, and share information. This takes the form of searching through more than [260 million research outputs](https://api.openalex.org/works), with the option to follow [>100 million authors](https://api.openalex.org/authors) and [>260 thousand sources](https://api.openalex.org/sources). Researchers organize outputs into research magazines according to their interests, building their reputation by highlighting other's research. Researchers also draft their own original contributions collaboratively and in real-time. These contributions can include text, but also other formats such as video, audio, and 3D models. A contribution can be as small as one figure or data point, or as big as an entire research report. Each contribution is open access and versioned transparently over time. To make sense of it all, researchers make connections between anyone's contributions to track important relations.

  <summary>Service: Supporting membership</summary>

Organizations that support ResearchEquals gain access to quarterly assemblies. At those assemblies we report on financial and project developments, and discuss next steps together. Supporters also get legal assurances that the project will not be bought up by a third-party without their consent.

The yearly contribution for organizations is >=â‚¬2,500.

## ...can be installed by anyone

We provide [researchequals.com](https://www.researchequals.com) for anyone who does not wish to install, set up, and manage it on their own computer. Those who choose to install and run the ResearchEquals software on their own computers, manage it at their own cost. Research conducting organizations can choose to buy a hosted ResearchEquals server. Both individual accounts and entire installations can be migrated at any time.

<details>
  <summary>Hosting services</summary>

We offer a basic hosting services to make it easier to run your own ResearchEquals server. We also provide customization of the installation to align the look and feel with that of your organization

Optional services that can be added to the hosting service are:

* ARK registration

* SSO/SAML integration

Pricing will follow.

<!-- **ResearchEquals provides increased knowledge security.** Unpublished drafts are end-to-end encrypted and only available to their authors. This way, sensitive research can be done securely. -->

<!-- **ResearchEquals is a piece of valuable technical infrastructure for small research conducting organizations.** Small organizations can use ResearchEquals to provide enterprise scale identity management for a fraction of the cost. This simplifies access to other services that are provided by the organization (for example, project management tools).

**Access to a ResearchEquals server integrates with existing identity management systems.** Your organization will not have to spend additional time ensuring every account has access to your server. It can be set up in such a way that if they can log in through your identity management system, their account is immediately validated. This provides seamless access upon installation. -->

## ...provides integrated and scalable archiving

During installation, there is the option to opt-in to a global archival network. This archival network ensures that on-the-record content is archived at regular intervals and can be found even if the service itself is shut down.

## ...is part of the Social Web

ResearchEquals servers go beyond the research ecosystem: They connect to services on the Social Web (for example, Mastodon). Your researchers will be available for questions, discussions, and perspectives previously unconsidered. They can also follow resources from across the Social Web, integrating them directly into their research environment. Researchers can keep their discussions off the record or choose to put them on the record. Each ResearchEquals server is also connected to each other.

## ...is a research information system

It documents everything from the people in your organization, the projects they do, to the funding they receive. It provides you with the tools to analyze these data from various perspectives and layers, to surface meaningful achievements of the organization's research portfolio. We provide seamless migration services from other research information systems to ensure your data continuity.

<details>
  <summary>Service: Migration from old RIS system</summary>

RIS is the backbone of a research conducting organization. Each migration is unique and needs to be carefully considered and managed. Upon migration of your RIS to ResearchEquals, migration between different installations is standardized and well-tested.

For price estimates, please contact us directly. Relevant information that helps us:

* Current RIS (for example, Pure, DSpace-CRIS)
* Size of the data migration (for example, 50,000 publications and 1000 authors)
* Costs to operate the current system
