# Why we exist

Liberate Science's purpose is to fulfill [Article 27 of the UN Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights) in its fullest sense:

1. Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits.
2. Everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which [they are] the author.

We exist to apply this right and expand what it means. We exist to be **creative** and **courageous** in pursuing this goal, **inspiring** action.

We exist as an independent organization to not compromise these rights any step of the way. We exist to be **generous** and pay forward our excesses, enabling others to work towards this goal from their own unique perspectives.
